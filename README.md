# Qcore

Qcore implements smart pointers, type introspection, efficient arrays and maps, fast sorting, about 20 image formats from scratch, image processing, various algorithms for data compression, some pieces from computational geometry, and a lightweight 3D engine.

In [Graphics/Color/](Qcore/Graphics/Color), you can see classes that are representing colors from several color models, namely RGB, RGBA, CMYK, CMYK-with-alpha, L*a*b*, L*a*b*-with-alpha, XYZ, and YCC, the class that represents colors in color palettes, as well as the ColorModelConversion class ([QColorModelConversion.h](Qcore/Graphics/Color/QColorModelConversion.h), [QColorModelConversion.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/Color/QColorModelConversion.cpp)) that lets you convert colors between different color models.

The puzzle of a hardware-based 3D engine is put together in [Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d). The engine was designed to be driver-abstract and allow for switching between OpenGL and DirectX by simply selecting the respective class to be used for 3D rendering. The OpenGL abstraction layer was implemented first ([QOpenGLRendering.h](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/OpenGL/QOpenGLRendering.h), [QOpenGLRendering.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/OpenGL/QOpenGLRendering.cpp), [QOpenGLRendering.inl](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/OpenGL/QOpenGLRendering.inl)) and turned out to be good enough to stay in solitude without any guests from Microsoft.

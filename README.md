# Qcore

Qcore implements smart pointers, type introspection, efficient arrays and maps, fast sorting, about 20 image formats from scratch, image processing, various algorithms for data compression, some pieces from computational geometry, and a lightweight 3D engine.

In [Graphics/Color/](Qcore/Graphics/Color), you can see classes that are representing colors from several color models, namely RGB, RGBA, CMYK, CMYK-with-alpha, L*a*b*, L*a*b*-with-alpha, XYZ, and YCC, as well as the ColorModelConversion class ([QColorModelConversion.h](Qcore/Graphics/Color/QColorModelConversion.h), [QColorModelConversion.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/Color/QColorModelConversion.cpp)) that lets you convert colors between different color models.

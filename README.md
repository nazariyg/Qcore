# Qcore

Qcore implements smart pointers, run-time type introspection, efficient arrays and maps, fast sorting, about 20 image formats from scratch, image processing, various algorithms for data compression, some pieces from computational geometry, and a lightweight 3D engine.

The primary concerns of the Qcore library is ease of use, performance, reliability, and overall Quality.

The platform-specific declarations in [System/QSystem.h](Qcore/System/QSystem.h) lay out a foundation upon which the the library is built, with the supported platforms being Windows (MSVC), OS X, and Linux.

The collection of classes in [Storage/Heap/](Qcore/Storage/Heap) makes possible a native look and feel of smart pointers in C++. Primarily implemented by the QHeap class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Heap/QHeap.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Heap/QHeap.cpp)) and its satellite QSmartPointer class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Heap/QSmartPointer.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Heap/QSmartPointer.inl)), the smart pointer system of Qcore take away most of the worries about when and how the memory allocated with the creation of an object of a class is going to be deallocated. An object of any class that derives from the QHeap class gets destructed, entailing the destruction of its member data and so on, and is deallocated automatically when the object's reference counter hits zero with the last smart pointer having detached from the object. On practice, smart pointers are just like native C++ pointers. A smart pointer evaluates to the address of the object it points to, its `->` operator is used for accessing the member functions and the member data of the object, `*` operator is used for dereferencing, `=` operator for assigning, and `==` and `!=` operators for comparison.

More efficient implementations that replace some of the container classes shipped with the C++ Standard Library are gathered in [Storage/Containment/](Qcore/Storage/Containment). The std::vector class of the C++ Standard Library loses its monopoly on array functionality and is replaced by a selection of three classes that the developer can choose from in order to optimize performance in each specific case of array use, and the classes are QStillArray ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QStillArray.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QStillArray.inl)), which is optimal for arrays that are expected to stay of the same size ever since they are created with a number of preallocated elements, QArray ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QArray.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QArray.inl)), which derives from the QDynamicArrayBase class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QDynamicArrayBase.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QDynamicArrayBase.inl)) and works best with arrays that are expected to grow or shrink dynamically and possibly by large numbers of elements, and QModestArray ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QModestArray.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QModestArray.inl)), which also derives from the QDynamicArrayBase class and is suitable for arrays that are expected to grow or shrink dynamically but with changes in the number of elements remaining small. Another essential container class is QMap ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QMap.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QMap.inl)) that replaces the associative array functionality of the std::map class with a highly efficient implementation of the red-black tree algorithm for key-value storage, and the QMap class accompanied with the QMapIterator class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QMapIterator.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QMapIterator.inl)) that implements iterator functionality for the container. Alternative to the QMap class, there is also the QHashMap class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QHashMap.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QHashMap.inl)) that improves the performance of key-value storage as long as the keys are kept small in size and is a more optimal choice over QMap if the keys are pointers or objects (which is equivalent to pointers), and the class goes together with the QHashMapIterator class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QHashMapIterator.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QHashMapIterator.inl)) for iterator functionality. Qcore also offer a wider choice for set functionality with the QSet class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QSet.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QSet.inl)) that implements storing unique values with the red-black tree algorithm and the QBsSet class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QBsSet.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QBsSet.inl)) that takes advantage of the very fast binary search algorithm for sets of values that require more search operations than insert operations. Doubly-linked lists are implemented by the QList class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QList.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QList.inl)) along with the QListIterator class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QListIterator.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Containment/QListIterator.inl)), which are most optimal for arrays that require frequent insertion or removal operations.

The QSortUtils class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Sorting/QSortUtils.h), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Sorting/QSortUtils.inl)), which is located in [Storage/Sorting/](Qcore/Storage/Sorting), provides a lightning-fast implementation of the most efficient Quicksort sorting algorithm and makes it be applicable to performing sorting on the elements in C++ native arrays, objects of the Qcore's array classes, as well as Qcore's doubly-linked lists, all with an option to use a custom comparator for the elements.

In [Graphics/Color/](Qcore/Graphics/Color), there are located classes that are representing colors from several color models, namely RGB, RGBA, CMYK, CMYK-with-alpha, L*a*b*, L*a*b*-with-alpha, XYZ, and YCC, the class that represents colors in color palettes, as well as the ColorModelConversion class ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/Color/QColorModelConversion.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/Color/QColorModelConversion.cpp)) that lets you convert colors between different color models.

In [Storage/Compression/](Qcore/Storage/Compression) you can find the classes that efficiently implement some of the most prominent data compression algorithms. The QCompressionLzw class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionLzw.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionLzw.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionLzw.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionLzw.mcr)) takes on high-performance compression and decompression using the variable-length-code Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm (LZW), which had its patent expired right about the time when QCompressionLzw was written, and the class supports 3 different LZW encoding types (general-purpose, GIF-like, and TIFF-like) as well as decompressing data in real-time from a dynamically growing stream of bytes by suspending and then resuming the decoding process. The wrapper over zlib library, which is the QCompressionZLib class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionZLib.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionZLib.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionZLib.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionZLib.mcr)), is able to suspend and resume decoding as well when decompressing from a dynamic data stream. The QCompressionDxt class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionDxt.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionDxt.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionDxt.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionDxt.mcr)) implements the DXT image compression, also known as S3TC, that is used by DDS textures in DirectX and that lets images to be decompressed extremely fast by simple hardware implementations while preserving color information fairly well; DXT compression, however, in not particularly simple and requires performing principal component analysis of the source image, which is implemented in the QPrincipalComponentsAnalysis class ([.h](Qcore/Statistics/QPrincipalComponentsAnalysis.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Statistics/QPrincipalComponentsAnalysis.cpp)). Other implemented algorithms are the Apple's PackBits algorithm ([.h](Qcore/Statistics/QCompressionPackBits.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Statistics/QCompressionPackBits.cpp)) that is still used by some image formats and the CCITT's FAX algorithm ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionFax.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionFax.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionFax.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Compression/QCompressionFax.mcr)) that works best with monochrome images.

A number of classes closely related to raster graphics and raster images have found their home in [Graphics/RasterImagic/](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic). Here you can find the QRasterImage class ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImage.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImage.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImage.inl)) that represents raster images and provides support for 10 color models (called "modes" in Photoshop), 33 different image types, and high-dynamic-range imaging (HDR). There is also the QRasterImageConversion class ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageConversion.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageConversion.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageConversion.inl)) that can convert a raster image from one image type into another, effectively converting between different color models and color precisions, and using a dedicated class, which is QRasterImageQuantization ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageQuantization.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageQuantization.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageQuantization.inl)), for finding the most optimal palette based when transforming a true-color image into an indexed image with minimum loss of information possible. Another class in this group, QRasterImageAdjustment ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageAdjustment.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageAdjustment.cpp)), lets you adjust brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, lightness, and gamma of an image, blur and sharpen images, as well as apply your own filters to images. The raster image class suite wouldn't be complete without a class for image transformations, which is QRasterImageTransformation ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageTransformation.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageTransformation.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageTransformation.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QRasterImageTransformation.mcr)) and is able to resize any of the 33 supported types of raster images, rotate image by an arbitrary angle, and skew images, all with any of the 7 supported interpolations, such as bilinear, bicubic, nearest-neighbor, and others. Finally, there is the QDiscretePlotting class ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QDiscretePlotting.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QDiscretePlotting.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QDiscretePlotting.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Graphics/RasterImagic/QDiscretePlotting.mcr)) that, as a part of the 2D capabilities of Qcore, implements the fastest algorithms for plotting lines, circles, ellipses, quadratic Bezier curves, and cubic Bezier curves in raster images.

Qcore happened to be especially fond of image formats, which are implemented with the classes that can be found in [Storage/Format/](Qcore/Storage/Format). Some of the nearly 20 implemented formats are PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PSD, BMP, TGA, and EXR, plus an implementation of the format used by EXIF metadata. With the QFormatPng class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPng.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPng.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPng.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPng.mcr)), the lossless PNG format is implemented to almost every smallest detail and the class lets PNG images to be loaded and saved with the support for 6 color models, bits-per-pixel ranging from 1 to 64, compression strategies optimized for either output size and speed, image interlacing for progressive display, and various PNG metadata, as well as loading an image from a dynamic PNG data stream when only a part of the PNG data is available; in the tests that were run with the QFormatPng class at the time, the implementation was showing unmatched performance and was even compressing images into files that were smaller than the respective PNG images produced by the highly acclaimed [pngcrush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pngcrush) utility while preserving the entire information in the output image. Another image format implementation that stands out is the implementation of the JPEG format in the QFormatJpeg class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatJpeg.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatJpeg.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatJpeg.inl)) that is relying on the highly-optimized, integer-arithmetics-only QDiscreteCosineTransformi class ([.h](Qcore/Mathematics/QDiscreteCosineTransformi.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Mathematics/QDiscreteCosineTransformi.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Mathematics/QDiscreteCosineTransformi.inl)) for discrete cosine transforms, which are at the heart of the JPEG format, and is realizing JPEG image loading and saving with a great emphasis made on performance and output image size, with the support for CMYK, grayscale, YCC, and YCCK color models in addition to just RGB, adjustable image quality for image compression, 2 chroma downsampling schemes, progressive data encoding and decoding, integrated EXIF metadata, and progressive image loading from a dynamic JPEG data stream. The QFormatTiff class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatTiff.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatTiff.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatTiff.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatTiff.mcr)) embodies one of the full-featured implementation of the TIFF format, with the support for 10 color models, 22 image types, arbitrary color precision, color components pre-multiplied with alpha, 7 compression methods, internal file directories, TIFF tags, different endianness, 8 possible image orientations, strip- and tile-oriented segment organization, images with color components organized in planes, visibility masks, multi-line text in TIFF metadata, as well as integrated EXIF metadata. Creating animated GIF images was made simple thanks to the QFormatGif class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatGif.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatGif.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatGif.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatGif.mcr)), which is able to load still and animated images and save animations with minimum output file sizes possible. While not being strictly an image format, the PSD format, which is used by Adobe Photoshop documents, has found its implementation in the QFormatPsd class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPsd.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPsd.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPsd.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatPsd.mcr)) that has support 5 color models together with their alpha-enabled counterparts, 16 bits per color component besides the regular 8 bits, composite images, layers, RLE compression (PackBits), and 23 blending modes. The aforementioned EXIF metadata format is implemented by the QFormatExif class ([.h](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatExif.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatExif.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatExif.inl), [.mcr](Qcore/Storage/Format/QFormatExif.mcr)), which provides support for scores of various EXIF tags relating to image data structure, recording offset, image data characteristics, versions, image configuration, user information, file information, date and time, picture-taking conditions, and more.

The puzzle of a hardware-based 3D engine is put together in [Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d). The engine was designed to be driver-abstract and allow for switching between OpenGL and DirectX by simply selecting the respective class to be used for 3D rendering. The OpenGL abstraction layer was implemented first ([.h](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/OpenGL/QOpenGLRendering.h), [.cpp](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/OpenGL/QOpenGLRendering.cpp), [.inl](Qcore/Graphics/HardwareRendering/Rendering3d/OpenGL/QOpenGLRendering.inl)) and turned out to be good enough to remain in perfect solitude.
